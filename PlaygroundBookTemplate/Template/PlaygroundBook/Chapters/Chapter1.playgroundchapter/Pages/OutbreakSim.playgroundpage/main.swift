#### An Outbreak infection simulator and herd immunity
On the right, there’s an infection simulator. The spheres correspond to people, while the lines correspond to a possible path of transmission.  Tap a node to vaccinate it. Once the outbreak starts, try to contain it by quarantining nodes by tapping them. The simulator starts in easy mode, but try out the different options! Beware of the anti-vax  nodes marked in yellow!

##### Herd immunity
A common phrase by healthcare professionals is that we need at least 75% of the population to be vaccinated to build herd immunity. So what’s herd immunity?

Herd immunity is when a large enough portion of a population is immune to a disease, which makes the spread of the disease much less likely. With herd immunity, the population is protected even though everyone is not vaccinated. Herd immunity is important as it protects those who are unable to get vaccinated for various reasons.

Try out the herd immunity difficulty and see how much an infection spreads!
