 # Vaccines and containing an outbreak
 #### How do Vaccines work?
 Vaccines work to give your immune system the memory of a virus so that when the virus does attempt to infect you, your immune system will recognize it and eliminate it and reduce your risk of a severe infection
 
 ##### Why do they matter for containing a disease?
 Vaccines not only save lives by reducing the severity of infections, but they also massively help reduce the transmission of a disease. The higher percentage of population thatâ€™s vaccinated, the fewer opportunities for the disease to spread to others.
